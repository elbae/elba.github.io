### chmod 
Changes the mode (permission) of a file or directory with either octal number representation and symbolic representation.

Octal representation
```
0   000   ---
1   001   --x
2   010   -w-
3   011   -wx
4   100   r--
5   101   r-x
6   110   rw-
7   111   rwx
```
examples
```
chmod 777 foo.txt --> -rwxrwxrwx 1 andrea andrea 1 mag 12 15:30 foo.txt
chmod 600 foo.txt --> -rw------- 1 andrea andrea 1 mag 12 15:30 foo.txt
chmod 640 foo.txt --> -rw-r----- 1 andrea andrea 1 mag 12 15:30 foo.txt
chmod 711 fox.txt --> -rwx--x--x 1 andrea andrea 1 mag 12 15:30 foo.txt
```

Symbolic representation:
```
- whom the change will affect: u,g,o,a (user,group owner, others, all)
- which operation will be performed: +-= (add,remove,apply and remove others)
- which permission will be set: rwx
```
examples:
```
chmod a=rwx foo.txt --> -rwxrwxrwx 1 andrea andrea 1 mag 12 15:30 foo.txt
chmod a-rwx,u=rw foo.txt --> -rw------- 1 andrea andrea 1 mag 12 15:30 foo.txt
```
### umask
Sets the file mode creation mask to mask & 0777 (uses only the permission bits). It uses octal notation to express a mask of bits to be removed from a file's mode attributes.

example:
```
umask 0002 --> -rw-rw-r-- 1 andrea andrea 0 mag 12 17:26 foo.txt
umask 0000 --> -rw-rw-rw- 1 andrea andrea 0 mag 12 17:26 foo.txt (default)
```

# setuid, setgid
Using chmod is possible to set uid and gid to root.
```
chmod u+s foo.txt --> -rwsrw-rw- 1 andrea andrea 0 mag 12 17:30 foo.txt
chmod g+d dir/
```
