# Title: Mida Solutions eFramework Multiple Vulnerabilities
### Date: 21/05/2020 (Last Update 15/07/2020)
### Author: Andrea Baesso
### Vendor Homepage: https://www.midasolutions.com/
### Software Link: https://ova-efw.midasolutions.com/
### Version: 2.8.9, 2.9.0
### Tested on: 2.8.9, 2.9.0

## Abstract
During my spare time I analized *independently* a publicly available product, not extremely widespread, but still used around the world. I found several vulnerabilities, reported to the vendor which **silently fixed** a few of them without a single answer to my e-mails.

## Company Description

The product comes as a preconfigured Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) which can be downloaded from the company's website and easily imported in production environments.

## Vulnerabilities highlight
Several vulnerabilities allow unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) through Command Injection on the system with administrative privileges. Any attacker may leverage the issue to obtain a remote shell, or directly execute system commands with the output returned in text format, and possibly access the internal network (if exposed in WAN).

### Vulnerabilities recap:
- 4 Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) through Command Injection. 
	- 4 different injection points
- 1 SQL Injection
- 1 Path traversal
- 1 Backdoor access (permits to change admin password)
- Several XSS (Reflected, Stored)

## POC

Complete POC will be released when the vulnerabilities are fixed or in few months (depends on vendor actions).
